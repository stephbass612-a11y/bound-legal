  <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong><br>
  <p>These terms and conditions apply to the Bound app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Stephanie Bassock (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service.</p>

  <strong>AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</strong>
  <p>The Application uses artificial intelligence (Google Gemini) to generate book summaries, recommendations, and other text. While we strive for accuracy, AI-generated content may occasionally be factually incorrect, misleading, or contain hallucinations.

The Service Provider assumes no liability for errors, omissions, or offensive material generated by the AI.</p>
